I was a teaching assistant for the course INF 6102, a graduate-level course on metaheuristics. This was my first teaching experience, allowing me to develop my pedagogical skills and ability to explain advanced material.

### Responsibilities

- Drafting assignments helped me familiarize myself with state-of-the-art metaheuristics to create high-level assignments.
- Correcting assignments and leading tutorials deepened my understanding of metaheuristics while teaching others.
- The experience confirmed that the best way to learn is to teach, and it helped me hone my ability to convey complex concepts effectively.
