## Hi! I’m Léo!
I’ve had the chance to wear a lot of hats in my career—from leading data science projects in industry and conducting academic research to hosting a radio show that breaks down complex AI topics for a broad audience. Whether it’s managing a team, diving deep into research, or communicating ideas in a way that’s easy to understand, I’ve always been driven by the challenge of making innovation both impactful and accessible.

I’ve worked on everything from developing optimization solvers using reinforcement learning to helping companies solve real-world logistics problems. My leadership experience has given me the opportunity to guide multi-disciplinary teams, navigate tricky technical challenges, and deliver tangible results in high-pressure environments.

Alongside my technical work, I’ve also spent time on the airwaves, hosting radio segments that demystify AI. This experience taught me a lot about how to communicate complex ideas clearly—and how important that is when it comes to research and collaboration. It’s one thing to tackle a hard problem, but it’s another to explain it in a way that resonates.

Now, I’m pursuing a PhD focused on LLM-based web agents because I truly believe in the potential of this technology. These agents can change how we interact with knowledge and perform tasks in digital environments, and my goal is to push the boundaries of what they can do. I’m excited to be working at the intersection of AI, communication, and leadership, and I’m looking forward to making meaningful contributions in this space.
