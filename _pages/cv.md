Work experience
======
* **March 2024 - Present: Visiting Researcher**
  * ServiceNow Research
  * Research Director: Alexandre Lacoste
  * This role marked a key moment in my research development, focusing on large-scale AI systems and LLM-based web agents. My first-author work on developing WorkArena++ has sharpened my project management skills and collaborative efforts within a large research team. A significant challenge was designing tasks representative of knowledge workers on web platforms, requiring an understanding of human cognitive processes translated into computational tasks.

* **Sept 2022 - Jan 2023: Master's Research**
  * Polytechnique Montréal
  * Supervisor: Quentin Cappart
  * My first real immersion into academic research. I applied project management skills to structure the work into distinct phases—literature review, code development, theoretical framework, and results analysis. This experience confirmed my aspiration to pursue doctoral studies.

* **Sept 2023 - Dec 2023: Consultant**
  * Comité de consultation en gestion Polytechnique
  * Supervisor: Mehdi Louzi
  * Led technical aspects of optimizing truck routes for Intelcom, reducing required trucks by 50-75%. Managed incomplete data, developed a route optimization program, and created a visualization tool for interpreting results, improving my project management and technical communication skills.

* **Jan 2023 - Apr 2023: Teaching Assistant**
  * Polytechnique Montréal
  * Supervisor: Quentin Cappart
  * Teaching assistant for INF 6102, a graduate course on metaheuristics. This experience helped me develop pedagogical skills, design assignments at an advanced level, and deepened my understanding of the subject through tutorials and assignment corrections.

* **Sept 2022 - Aug 2023: Lead Developer – SeaPearl.jl**
  * Supervisor: Quentin Cappart
  * Significantly improved the quality of the SeaPearl.jl project, a reinforcement learning-based constraint programming solver. Increased test coverage by 15%, created comprehensive documentation, and mentored two interns. Under my leadership, the project gained visibility with 90 GitHub stars and competed in its first solver competition.

* **Jan 2021 - Jun 2022: Team Lead, Data Science**
  * Newtrax Technologies
  * Supervisor: Louis-Pierre Campeau
  * Led the data science product lifecycle from concept to production. Set up the company's first system-level reliability tests, achieving over 99.99% prediction accuracy. Managed data annotation strategy, growing the team’s product line from 2 to 10.

* **Sept 2019 - Jan 2021: Data Scientist**
  * Newtrax Technologies
  * Supervisor: Louis-Pierre Campeau
  * Developed the first activity detection products for the company, achieving over 99% prediction accuracy. Managed end-to-end product development, including DevOps aspects. Established coding standards and test practices for the growing team.

* **May 2019 - Aug 2019: Machine Learning Intern**
  * Newtrax Technologies
  * Supervisor: Louis-Pierre Campeau
  * Worked on anomaly detection in the mining sector, implementing and evaluating four deep learning models on real data. Presented results to Sandvik's team in Finland after their acquisition of Newtrax.

* **May 2018 - Apr 2019: Consultant in Modeling and Simulation**
  * DIREXYON Technologies
  * Supervisor: Kevin Lacombe
  * Developed a strategic maintenance model for urban infrastructure, reducing costs by 30% while maintaining asset availability.
